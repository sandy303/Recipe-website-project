# README

It's a website that would:

1. Fetch the recipe information based on a search term entered in the address bar
2. Display the information in an HTML table - specifically, the **recipe photo**, the **recipe title** (both of which would be links that can take you to the actual recipe) and the **ingredients** required for the recipe.

-But this done y using Ruby On Rails, which is the fastest prototyping framework.
-Rails is a framework for making dynamic web pages (Interact with database or any other data source).
-Here, we don't use any kind of Database, but ruby pulls the data from internet/ web services and integrates that data into our Ruby On Rails application.
